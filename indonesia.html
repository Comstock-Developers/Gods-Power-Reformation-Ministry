									<h5>Pixabay Bali</h5>
									<p>For many people, Bali is beaches. Arguably Indonesia's most popular vacation spot, 
										Bali has a number of cultural landmarks and traditions that make a visit here worthwhile. 
										But anyone who travels to Bali is going to have warm sand and blue water on their mind, and the island doesn't disappoint.
										Kuta is the best known beach, and is great for those who like to combine sun, surfing, and socializing. Because of its popularity, 
										you'll find no shortage of restaurants and activities here. If you're looking for something a little quieter and less crowded, 
										Nusa Dua is still a beauty, but draws fewer tourists. 
										Sanur is the place to go for a little more culture as well as great water sports.

									<h5>Gili Islands</h5>
									<p>The Gili Islands are a major draw in Lombok, which has risen in popularity among backpackers and tourists in recent years. 
										These picturesque islands offer beaches that rival those of Bali in their beauty, as well as opportunities for diving and even snorkeling at a turtle sanctuary. 
										If you're looking for more turtle action, you can check out a turtle hatchery where hundreds of these creatures are born each year. 
										Kayaking is also popular in the Gilis, and if you're seeking a place to reconnect with your mind and body, you will find several options for yoga classes. 
										The Gili Islands provide a more relaxed, though still stimulating, alternative to popular Bali.

									<h5>Raung Mountains</h5>
									<p>Indonesia sits on the Ring of Fire, an area with some of the most active volcanoes in the world. 
										Many of the country's volcanoes, such as Mount Merapi, are famous for their violent eruptions and their stunning, but dangerous beauty. 
										Mount Bromo is among the best known, thanks largely to its incredible views, particularly when seen standing over the caldera at sunrise. 
										Bromo's peak was blown off in an eruption, and you can still see white smoke spewing from the mountain. 
										The volcano is part of Bromo Tengger Semeru National Park, which also includes Mount Semeru, the highest peak in Java. The park is home to the Tengger people,
										an isolated ethnic group who trace their ancestry back to the ancient Majapahit empire.

							<p>The Indonesian archipelago is a collection of islands that holds untold treasures in its diversity of cultures, landscapes, and cities. 
								With nearly 13,500 islands under its jurisdiction, Indonesia offers an adventure for everyone, 
								from exploring ancient temples and hiking active volcanoes to diving in largely untouched waters. 
								You can wander the busy streets of Jakarta, or take a step back in time with a visit to the remote villages of Tana Toraja; indulge in the bliss of Bali,
								or come face to face with the volatile Anak Krakatau. Whatever you choose, 
								the experience is sure to be one filled with awe and appreciation for a country as steeped in history and natural beauty as this one.
							</p>
							<h3>Borobudur</h3>
							<p>This ancient temple is one of the most famous and culturally significant landmarks in Indonesia. 
								Borobudur was built in the 8th century and constructed in the shape of a traditional Buddhist mandala. 
								It is a UNESCO World Heritage site, and is considered one of the greatest Buddhist sites in the world. 
								The massive temple was forgotten for centuries, when it is believed that much of the population moved to eastern Java due to volcanic eruptions. 
								But it was rediscovered in the 1800s and, today, is one of the main draws in Java. 
								Visit at sunrise for a torch-light climb up the temple and for the breathtaking experience of watching as the complex is bathed in sunlight. 
								Borobudur lies near Yogyakarta, an old Javanese city known for its rich cultural and historical offerings.
							</p>

							<p>The beaches may be the first thing that comes to mind when you think of Bali, but the verdant rice fields are a close second. 
								So lush and life-giving are the terraces of the Jatiluwih Rice Fields that they were designated a UNESCO Cultural Landscape as part of Bali's Subak System. 
								The meticulously cultivated and irrigated fields are a testament to the wealth of natural resources in Bali, as well as the carefully honed skills of the local farmers. 
								No visit to Bali is complete without seeing these rich acres.
