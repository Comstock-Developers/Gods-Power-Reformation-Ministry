											<h5>Beach Cottages</h5>
											<p>The coastline north of Mombasa is a little livelier than the south coast, and the resorts are closer to the airport and Mombasa City. 
												Palm-lined beaches, crystal clear waters, coral reefs, and a profusion of water sports, 
												resorts, and entertainment venues provide plenty of tourist action.</p>

											<h5>Mombasa</h5>
											<p>Mombasa Marine National Park fringes the coast here, with multi-hued coral gardens, drop offs, and Kenya's best wreck diving on the MV Dania. 
												Traveling north from Mombasa, Nyali Beach is the first stop. Shops and hotels line the beach here. Farther north, 
												Bamburi Beach and Shanzu Beach are also tourist hubs with a wide range of accommodation, from luxury resorts to beach bungalows.</p>

											<h5>Besides Mombasa</h5>
											<p>Besides the beautiful beaches and exotic attractions of Mombasa, Kenya is rich in colonial history and wildlife adventures. 
												In Nairobi, Kenya's capital and largest city, you can see where the famous Out of Africa author lived at the Karen Blixen Museum, 
												and tour safari parks and wildlife sanctuaries near the city. In fact both Kenya and its southern neighbor, Tanzania, have some of the Best Game Reserves in Africa. 
												Tanzania's largest city, Dar es Salaam, lies a short boat ride from beautiful Bongoyo and Mbudya Islands, and you can even fly to the sublime Seychelles from Kenya.

											<h5>Casablanca club</h5>
											<p>The Casablanca Club is the largest nightspot in the city, with two clubs, two dance floors and five bars. 
												If you’re a fan of disco, you can hit the dance floor and enjoy the modern tunes on the playlist. 
												Or if you like sport, you can see the latest games on the big screen in the TV lounge. You can also see exotic dancers or chill out on the club balcony.
												Open 24 hours, you’ll find plenty of locals and tourists alike in this popular spot.

											<h5>Watamu</h5>
											<p>About 112 kilometers from Mombasa, Watamu is a Swahili fishing village that has blossomed into a small beach resort and offers superb snorkeling and diving. 
												The coast is broken into three coves divided by rocky headlands. Offshore from Watamu is the southern part of the Malindi Marine National Reserve. 
												The forests of the Arabuko Sokoke Forest Reserve and the Swahili ruins of Gede are also close by. More than 600 species of fish are found within the marine reserve,
												and whale sharks and manta rays are seasonal visitors to the reef.

											<h5>South Coast Beaches</h5>
											<p>The coastline south of Mombasa is a world of natural beauty. Turquoise seas lap the sun-bleached beaches, where tourists sprawl under rustling palms. 
												Rainforests with abundant wildlife and birds skirt this idyllic stretch of coast, and coral reefs protect the swimming areas from offshore swells. 
												Shelly Beach, just south of the Likoni Ferry, is the closest beach to Mombasa along the south coast. Tiwi Beach, 17 kilometers south of the Likoni Ferry, is a popular spot for sunbathers and snorkelers. 
												Diani Beach is the most developed area along this stretch, but still offers beautiful beachscapes. 
												European package tourists flock here to enjoy the busy lineup of water sports - from windsurfing, sailing, snorkeling, and diving to water-skiing and parasailing.</p>

							<p>Mombasa, Kenya's second largest city after Nairobi, offers travelers an exotic taste of the African tropics steeped in centuries of seafaring history. 
								This cosmopolitan tourist hub is actually an island connected by bridges and ferries to the Kenyan coast. 
								Stretching for miles along the mainland to the north and south, Mombasa's beach resorts preside over palm-studded strands fringed by shimmering coral reefs.
								Tourists from Europe and beyond flock here to enjoy the many things to do - from dolphin spotting trips on traditional dhows and deep-sea fishing to diving and snorkeling the wrecks and reefs and basking on the sun-splashed shores.
								But in the city itself, on the bustling island, a world of history and culture awaits.</p>
						 
							<p>Thanks to its legacy as the largest port in East Africa, Mombasa is a cultural melting pot.
								British, Asian, Arabic, Omanis, Indian, and Chinese immigrants have enriched the city's architecture and cuisine,
								and many mosques and temples grace the city streets. In the Old Town, where fragrant spices waft from local markets, 
								you can step back in time and explore the ancient buildings. Beyond the city, wildlife parks, villages,
								and ancient ruins round out the wealth of water-based fun.
							</p>

							<p>For first-time visitors to Mombasa, the best area to stay is along the northern beaches: Nyali, Mombasa, Bamburi, 
								and Shanzu. From here, visitors can snorkel the coral reefs of Mombasa Marine National Park, which fringes this stretch of coast. 
								The Haller Park nature reserve is nearby, 
								and Mombasa's Old Town, with Fort Jesus, is a short drive away.
